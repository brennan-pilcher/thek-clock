# Thek Clock
An experiment made with [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) for my Outsider Art class in 2015.

For this assignment, we were asked to read [Paul Thek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thek)'s ["Teaching Notes"](http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall16/173/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Thek-Teaching-Notes.pdf) and choose one of the instructions as the basis for a creative project. I decided on "Design a new clock face." from note \#30.

The idea for my project was to subvert the preconceived notions about how a clock "should" look and function. The aesthetic grounding for the clock is a stylized, abstract Earth with the Sun circling it. In an inverse of reality, the clock's Sun orbits around the Earth once per year. A black dot circles around the Earth once per day. There is no "minute hand", but a disc in the center completes a full revolution every sixty seconds. Behind the Earth is a randomized star field.

Included along with "thek-clock.html" which reflects the current time are static versions for Christmas Day and the United States' Independence Day.
